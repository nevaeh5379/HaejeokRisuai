## 2024-05-14 - Replace JSON.parse(JSON.stringify) with structuredClone
**Learning:** Found usage of JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) for deep cloning in some files, despite a safeStructuredClone polyfill being available. structuredClone is generally faster for deep cloning and can handle more types (like Map, Set, Date, RegExp, etc) than JSON stringification.
**Action:** Replace JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) with safeStructuredClone in src/ts/cbs.ts and src/ts/process/request/openAI/responses.ts.
## 2024-05-24 - Deep Cloning Performance
**Learning:** Native `structuredClone` and `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` have performance/compatibility issues in this environment. The codebase has a custom `safeStructuredClone` in `src/ts/polyfill.ts` that falls back to `rfdc` (Really Fast Deep Clone) which is highly optimized for this stack.
**Action:** Always use `safeStructuredClone` from `src/ts/polyfill.ts` for deep cloning instead of native methods.
